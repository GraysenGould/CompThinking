    "#### Think about the new house example. You have just moved into a new house today and you have found a toolbox in the garage with a hammer, some nails and a screwdriver (and these are your only tools by the way!). These tools are similar to the built-in functions you find in Python. Functions like print(), type(), and input() that are already there and you just call and use them whenever you need. Now, let's say you need to change a roof light. You have a bulb but you have no ladder so you can't get that high. In a case like this, you may decide to put some boxes on top of each other and use them as steps. This steps-like tool that you created to solve the problem is very similar to a user-defined function. A tool that was not there by default and you created (designed, defined) it to serve your purpose.      <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The next morning, you wake up and notice that your lawn is very long and you decide to cut it but ... with the tools that you have it is extremely hard to cut lawn, if not impossible. What would you do then? At this point, you would probably ask a neighbor or a friend for the mower or go to a shop and buy or rent a mower, bring it home and cut your lawn. This is very similar to importing an external module in python. We bring in a tool that we need to solve a problem. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moduels provide additional functionality to the basic Python package, much like a new piece of equipment adds functionality to a tool box. Just like in the house, importing too many libraries can sometimes complicate and slow down your programs - so we only import what we need for each program. <br>\n",
