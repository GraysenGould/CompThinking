    "## Functions\n",

    "> In mathematics, a function[note 1] is a binary relation between two sets that associates each element of the first set to exactly one element of the second set. Typical examples are functions from integers to integers, or from the real numbers to real numbers.Functions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity. \n",
    "- Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You may be familiar with the mathematical concept of a function. A function is a relationship or mapping between one or more inputs and a set of outputs. In mathematics, a function is typically represented like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://files.realpython.com/media/t.74ec5430f457.png) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here, f is a function that operates on the inputs x and y. The output of the function is z. However, programming functions are much more generalized and versatile than this mathematical definition. In fact, appropriate function definition and use is so critical to proper software development that virtually all modern programming languages support both built-in and user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In programming, a function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.\n",

    "## Python Built in Functions\n",
    "#### Python has a set of built-in functions and we have already seen and worked with many of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LxITc.png) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Each of these built-in functions performs a specific task. The code that accomplishes the task is defined somewhere, but you don’t need to know where or even how the code works. All you need to know about is the function’s interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "> What arguments (if any) it takes <br>\n",
    "> What values (if any) it returns <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Then you call the function and pass the appropriate arguments. Program execution goes off to the designated body of code and does its useful thing. When the function is finished, execution returns to your code where it left off. The function may or may not return data for your code to use, as the examples above do."

    "## Python User Defined Functions\n",
    "#### Python allows us to define our own functions. When you define your own Python function, it works just the same as a built in function: From somewhere in your code, you’ll call your Python function and program execution will transfer to the body of code that makes up the function. When the function is finished, execution returns to the location where the function was called. Depending on how you designed the function’s interface, data may be passed in when the function is called, and return values may be passed back when it finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why define functions?\n",
    "- ***Abstraction and Reusability*** : When we need to use a set of actions (e.g., operations and instructions) often in our code, A good solution is to define a Python function that performs the task. Anywhere in your application that you need to accomplish the task, you simply call the function. Down the line, if you decide to change how it works, then you only need to change the code in one location, which is the place where the function is defined. The changes will automatically be picked up anywhere the function is called. <br>\n",
    "- ***Modularity*** : Functions allow complex processes to be broken up into smaller steps. Breaking a large task into smaller, bite-sized sub-tasks helps make the large task easier to think about and manage. As programs become more complicated, it becomes increasingly beneficial to modularize them in this way. (Divide-and-conquer algorithm) <br>\n",
    "- ***Namespace Separation*** : A namespace is a region of a program in which identifiers have meaning. When a Python function is called, a new namespace is created for that function, one that is distinct from all other namespaces that already exist. The practical upshot of this is that variables can be defined and used within a Python function even if they have the same name as variables defined in other functions or in the main program. This means that when you write code within a function, you can use variable names and identifiers without worrying about whether they’re already used elsewhere outside the function. This helps minimize errors in code considerably. <br>\n",
