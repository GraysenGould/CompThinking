    "### Warning: Relying on AI to Write Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "While AI tools, such as CoPilot and ChatGPT, can assist in generating Python code and providing coding solutions, it is crucial to be cautious when relying solely on these tools. For this course we expect that all your solution be your own code but you can use AI to see different approaches to the solution. \n",
    "#### Some important considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy:** AI-generated code may contain errors or bugs. Always review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it meets your requirements and functions correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding:** Relying too heavily on AI can impede your understanding of the underlying concepts and logic. It is essential to comprehend the code and the principles behind it to write efficient and effective programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Security:** AI tools may not always consider security best practices. Ensure that your code adheres to security standards and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Customization:** AI-generated code may not be tailored to your specific needs or constraints. Customize and adapt the code as necessary to fit your particular use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Learning:** Writing code manually and solving problems on your own helps build valuable skills and knowledge. Use AI as a supplement, not a replacement, for learning and problem-solving.\n",
