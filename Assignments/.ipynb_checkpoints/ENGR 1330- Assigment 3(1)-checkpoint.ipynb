    "**As part of this assignment, you will have to create a module as .py file, containing 2 variable definitions and 2 function definitions. The 2 variables, named secretnumber and secretname will contain a 2 digit integer and a word (i.e string) of 5 letters or less .(20 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**One function will be about making a user to guess the number. The function should not take any argument. In the function, use a loop to repeatedly ask the user to enter a number by input function. Everytime compare the entered number against secretnumber; if the number is smaller than secretnumber, print a message \"Guess higher\"; if found greater, then print \"Guess lower\". If the entered number matches secretnumber, then the user wins, so print a message \"You win!!\" and exit the loop. Otherwise, if the user trials exceed 10 attempts, print a message \"You lose\". (50 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The other function will be about guessing the secretname. Up on entering the function, it will print a string made of asterisks, as many letters there are in the secrectname. Then using a loop, it will repeatedly ask user to enter a letter using input function; if the entered letter is anywhere in the secrectname, then replace the asterisk in that position by the letter, otheriwse print a meesage that the letter is not in the name. If all asterisks are replaced by letters, print \"You win!!\" and exit the loop; otherwise, if the user trials exceed 10 attempts, then print \"You lose\".(80 points)**\n",

    "    Example: Say, the secretname is \"rose\"; the function will print \"****\" to indicate there are 4 letters. Then if I enter \"e\", it will print \"***e\"; if I enter \"a\", it will print \"a is not in the name\"; if I enter \"r\", it will print \"r**e\", and so on.\n"
